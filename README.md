# DungeonGame - an unnamed game for Ludum Dare 47

The idea around the "Stuck in a Loop" theme was a two-player game, where they both are stuck in an AI powered dungeon
that tries to keep them in a loop and bring each of them back to the room they started at. The two players' goal is to
find each other, and using special objects that they find in the maze, escape the maze.

However, since I only had ~12 hours for the Ludum Dare, in reality the game is just a dungeon that one player explores, with
no goal and no other player.

However the dungeon generation went well and it looks neat. :D
